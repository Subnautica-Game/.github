## 🧠 Overview  

**Subnautica** is an immersive survival adventure set on an alien ocean world, where players must explore, gather resources, and build tools to survive the depths. Stranded after crash-landing on the water-covered planet 4546B, you’ll dive into vibrant underwater environments teeming with life—both beautiful and dangerous.

The core gameplay blends exploration, crafting, and base construction. As you descend into deeper waters, you’ll encounter exotic ecosystems, mysterious ruins, and increasingly perilous fauna. Managing oxygen, resources, and health is critical, especially when navigating deeper biomes where the unknown lurks in every shadow.

Subnautica’s narrative unfolds organically through environmental storytelling, audio logs, and the remnants of previous explorers. The result is a compelling experience driven by curiosity, wonder, and survival instinct.
